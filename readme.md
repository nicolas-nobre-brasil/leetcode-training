# 🚀 LeetCode Training & Study Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode** solutions repository! Here, I store my solutions to various platform problems, organizing my studies and tracking my progress in solving programming challenges.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Serve as a **learning record** and progress tracker for LeetCode problems.
- Help other developers also studying algorithms and data structures.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by categories and difficulty levels:

```
/leetcode-training
├── easy/       # Easy problems
├── medium/     # Intermediate problems
├── hard/       # Hard problems
└── README.md   # Main documentation
```

Each file name is the number of the problem. The solution code includes the question description and the examples.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Currently, solutions are implemented in:
- **Python** 🐍 (main language)
- **Go** (second language)
