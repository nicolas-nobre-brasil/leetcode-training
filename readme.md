# 🚀 LeetCode Training & Study Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode** solutions repository! Here, I store my solutions to various platform problems, organizing my studies and tracking my progress in solving programming challenges.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Serve as a **learning record** and progress tracker for LeetCode problems.
- Share well-documented and commented solutions for easy future review.
- Explore different approaches and optimizations in problem-solving.
- Help other developers also studying algorithms and data structures.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by categories and difficulty levels:

```
/leetcode-training
├── easy/       # Easy problems
├── medium/     # Intermediate problems
├── hard/       # Hard problems
└── README.md   # Main documentation
```

Each solution includes a brief summary, time/space complexity, and an explanation of the reasoning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Currently, solutions are implemented in:
- **Python** 🐍 (main language)
- **C++** (for optimization when necessary)
- **JavaScript** (for practice with web-related problems)

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired category:
   ```bash
   cd leetcode/medium
   ```
3. Run the solution (example in Python):
   ```bash
   python problem_xyz.py
   ```
