"""Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
 
Example 1:
    Input: x = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Example 2:
    Input: x = 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
