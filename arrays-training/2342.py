"""
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. 
You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, 
and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].

Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain 
over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions.

 

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
    Output: 54
    Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
    - (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
    - (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
    So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
